    <h1>Happy Girlfriend Day!</h1>
    <p>
      Anvesha my love , <br><br>
      I do not know how to perfectly say what you mean to me, but I do know this—you are the only person who makes my heart feel safe, even when my world is falling apart. You have seen sides of me I hide from everyone, but I still want to be real with you because you are the only one I truly trust with my soul. I may not be the strongest, and I have made mistakes that hurt you—and that breaks me inside—but please know my love for you is pure, deep, and unmatched. You are not just someone I love… you are the reason I believe love like this exists. If I could give you my peace, I would. If I could take your pain and make it mine, I would do it without a second thought. On this day, I do not just want to celebrate you—I want to thank you for staying with me, even when I did not make it easy. I love you more than words can ever carry.
